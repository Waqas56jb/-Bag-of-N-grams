# 🚀 Multi-Class Text Classification Project 🚀

## 🔍 Overview
Welcome to my **NLP Text Classification** project! This repository contains a complete implementation of a **Multi-Class Text Classification** model, where the goal is to classify news articles into one of three categories: **Business**, **Sports**, or **Crime**. 🌍

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
This project leverages the following tools and technologies:

- **Python** 🐍: The core programming language used for this project.
- **Spacy** 🧠: For advanced text preprocessing, including stopwords removal and lemmatization.
- **Scikit-learn (Sklearn)** ⚙️: To implement various machine learning classification algorithms.
- **Pandas** 🐼: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy** 📊: For numerical computations and array handling.

   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages** 📦:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook** 📔:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/Text_Classification.ipynb
   ```

## ⚙️ Model Performance
The following models were trained and evaluated for their performance:

| Model                     | Accuracy 🏆 |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Decision Tree Classifier**   | 73% 📉       |
| **Multinomial Naive Bayes**    | 83% 📈       |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  | 87% 🔥       |
| **Random Forest Classifier**   | 88% 🎯       |
| **Gradient Boosting Classifier**| 89% 🥇      |

The **Gradient Boosting Classifier** emerged as the best-performing model with an accuracy of **89%**. 🚀

## 🔍 Key Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes stopwords removal, lemmatization, and text vectorization.
- **Multiple Classification Models**: Evaluated various machine learning algorithms.
- **Model Persistence**: Saved trained models using `pickle` for future use.

## 🌟 Future Work
- Experiment with **deep learning models** such as **LSTM** or **BERT**.
- Extend the project to include tasks like **sentiment analysis** and **named entity recognition (NER)**.

## 💡 Inspiration
This project was inspired by the growing need for accurate text classification in various industries such as news categorization, sentiment analysis, and customer feedback processing.
